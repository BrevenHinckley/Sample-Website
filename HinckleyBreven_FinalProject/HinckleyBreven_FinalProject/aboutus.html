			<h2 class="about">Our History</h2>
			<p class="stripe"></p>
			<p class="text">In 1985, fresh out of college, John Winter was looking to make a splash in the business world. After a few years of working for other firms, Winter was convinced that he could run his own firm better than anyone else out there. Winter joined forces with top tax advisor Pete Edwards, and later added his personal friend, investment guru Daniel Boyd. Together they formed a top notch staff ready handle nearly any financial issue possible. The W.E.B. company adopted the motto; "We don't just handle fiance, we are problem solvers." This motto has set them apart in the industry. Anyone can crunch numbers for your company, but W.E.B. offers business and financial solutions so that anyone who is willing to hire us can thrive in their industry. Through this model, W.E.B. has been the top finance firm in Springfield, Missouri for the past 20 years.</p>
